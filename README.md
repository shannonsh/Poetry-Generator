# Features:
This poem engine can generate two kinds of poems: Haikus and freeform poems.
### Haiku: 


> light Lifts up that which  
Thou that calls thee partake do  
With this i say since  

--Shakespeare rendered as a Haiku

The haiku is generated by taking a selection of a writer's work (the default is all of Shakespeare's writings) and parsing which words appear after another. 

So if Shakespeare wrote on separate occasions "The flower..." "the sky" "the flame", the dictionary containing his writings would look like `{the: "flower", "sky", "flame}`.

Once the user specifies a "seed" word to start the poem with, the program looks through the dictionary and randomly selects a word that has appeared after the word the user has chosen (in the case of 'the', the next word according to the example above would be either "flower", "sky", or "flame"). Then that randomly chosen word is used as the new "seed" to choose the next word, and so on. Additional weight is given to words that appear together often.

The writing sample must be located in the folder 'poem engine'

### Freeform poem: 
> Why does the research paper persuade?  
Never appropriate a birdcage.  
The outstanding pail overnight resembles the gross.  
Satisfaction is a alternative .  
Hurt is too solid to accompany.

The freeform poems are generated by randomly filling out "sentence patterns", where the structure of the sentence is manually defined by something like `"The [adjective] [noun]  is like a [adjective] [noun]"` (think Mad Libs). To create a theme, the nouns are pulled from a predefined dictionary of nouns relevant to that theme (such as "dog", "raccoon", "chimpanzee" for the theme "animals").

The user can add more sentence formats by modifying the file 'sentencePatterns.txt'. Each line in the file corresponds to one sentence pattern. 

The parts of speech is denoted as follows: 
* [N] -> Concrete noun
