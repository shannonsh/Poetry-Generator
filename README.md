# Features:
This poem engine can generate two kinds of poems: Haikus and freeform poems.
### Haiku: 
The haiku is generated by taking the word that is inputted by the user and choosing a random word that appeared after the first word in the writing sample provided by the user, then repeating the process until it has reached the appropriate number of syllables for each line of the haiku.

The writing sample must be located in the folder 'poem engine'

### Freeform poem: 
The freeform poem is generated by randomly putting words together in preset sentence formats according to a theme defined by the user. 

The user can add more sentence formats by modifying the file 'sentencePatterns.txt'. Each line in the file corresponds to one sentence pattern.
